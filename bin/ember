# Thin wrapper script to execute ember commands in the correct working directory. 
# All ember commands need to be run inside the client/ dir. To save remembering
# to change directories, just run `bin/ember ...` from the project root. All
# ember commands will work. For usage enter `bin/ember --help`

# Ensure npm setup OK
source bin/npm_setup

# ember command working directory must be client/:
cd client

# Forward args to npm-installed ember command:
ember "$@"

# Return to project root:
cd ..

# Ensure npm setup *still* OK. Fixes issue where `ember install`-ing an addon
# forks the shared package.json.
source bin/npm_setup
