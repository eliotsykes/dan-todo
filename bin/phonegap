# Thin wrapper script to execute phonegap commands in the correct working directory. 
# All phonegap commands need to be run inside the client/wrap dir. To save remembering
# to change directories, just run `bin/phonegap ...` from the project root. All
# phonegap commands will work. For usage enter `bin/phonegap --help`

# phonegap command working directory must be client/wrap:
cd client/wrap

# Ensure path symlinked to from www exists to make phonegap serve happy:
symlink_target_path=$(readlink www)
mkdir -p $symlink_target_path

# Forward args to bin/phonegap to npm-installed phonegap command:
phonegap "$@"

# Return to project root:
cd ../..
