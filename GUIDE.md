# App Development Guide

## public/index.html is an app

```bash
cd my-rails-app
git co -b index-html-app
```

Create `public/index.html` with some intentionally simple content. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Todos</title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <!-- Don't worry about stylesheets and scripts for now -->
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Todos</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Get milk</li>
    <li>Read book</li>
    <li>Find tickets</li>
  </ul>
  <button onclick="alert('Thank You!');">Press Me</button>
</body>
</html>
```

Run `bin/rails s`, visit [http://localhost:3000] and check you see `public/index.html`.

It may not seem like much now, but this HTML page is where your app begins. You'll add features soon, but first you're getting this app on to your phone.


## Getting the app on your phone for development

Install PhoneGap command line client:

```bash
# Assumes node and npm are installed.
# -g flag installs phonegap globally:
npm install -g phonegap
```

Make a new subdirectory, 'client/wrap', of your existing Rails application. This is the directory PhoneGap will perform its work in:

```bash
cd my-rails-app
mkdir -p client/wrap
```

Create a new PhoneGap app, using `--id` and `--name` options of your choice. For example:

```bash
phonegap create client/wrap --id "com.appsfromdan.todo" --name "My Todos"
```

This will create a few directories in `client/wrap`, including a `www` directory.

The `www` directory is where PhoneGap expects to find `index.html`. PhoneGap has generated a default `index.html` in that location, but we won't be using that, so we can safely remove it:

```bash
rm client/wrap/www/index.html
```

Now create a symlink to your `public/index.html`:

```bash
ln -s ../../../public/index.html client/wrap/www/index.html
```

(Check the symlink is correct by trying to open the `client/wrap/www/index.html` file in an editor).

Install the PhoneGap Developer app on a phone or tablet that you have connected to the same Wi-Fi network that your computer is connected to. This phone/tablet is the first device you will test your app on. The PhoneGap Developer app can be installed free from the major app stores and is made by Adobe:

- [Apple App Store (iOS) - install PhoneGap Developer](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id843536693)
- [Google Play (Android) - install PhoneGap Developer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.phonegap.app)
- [Windows Phone Store - install PhoneGap Developer](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/phonegap-developer/5c6a2d1e-4fad-4bf8-aaf7-71380cc84fe3)

To see our own app on the device, startup the PhoneGap server from the command line. Pay special attention to the the IP address and port number output, you'll be needing this shortly:

```bash
# Be in the PhoneGap working directory:
cd client/wrap/

# Start up the PhoneGap server:
phonegap serve

# Output from server will look like:
[phonegap] starting app server...
[phonegap] listening on AN_IP_AND_PORT_ON_YOUR_NETWORK
```

Open the PhoneGap Developer app on your device. Enter the IP address and port given in the output from the PhoneGap server. You can enter these details by tapping on the "Server Address" field displayed in the PhoneGap Developer app. Then tap the Connect button.

Assuming there are no network issues (check the device and the computer are on the same network), your app will appear on your device. You should see the `index.html` you created on your device, congratulations! 

This is your basic development environment. Any changes you make to `public/index.html` will be detected by PhoneGap which will tell your device to reload your app.

Check PhoneGap's auto-reload feature is working by saving a minor edit to `public/index.html` on your computer. Check you can see the change appear on the device within a few seconds. The log output from PhoneGap server ought to be similar to this:

```bash
[phonegap] file changed /some/path/to/client/wrap/www/index.html
[phonegap] 200 /__api__/autoreload
[phonegap] 200 /
[phonegap] 200 /socket.io/?EIO=2&transport=polling&t=1234567890123-1&sid=abc1xyzA12BcdefgWXYZ
```

Add these changes and the new `client` directory to version control.

In the next stage you'll get to compile you app so it can be installed on devices *without* installing the PhoneGap Developer app.
